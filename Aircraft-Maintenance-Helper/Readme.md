## Aircraft-Maintenance-Helper

### Introduction

With Aircraft-Maintenance-Helper, Aircraft Maintenance will be much easier and more efficiently!

- Take control of flight information on one screen.
- Make status prediction and get a maintenance health monitor in one second.
- Recognize the target components by one photo.
- Navigate to related pages of manuals in one step.

### Development

We develop this application with [uni-app](https://uniapp.dcloud.io/), which is a framework for developing cross-platform applications using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

Since uni-app has not supported packaging project as a `.ipa` file yet, please use [HBuilderX](https://www.dcloud.io/hbuilderx.html) if you want to test the application. But if needed, we can upload it to the App Store. 

In addition, we have developed a prototype and please refer to `\Prototype` directory and intuitively see how the Aircraft-Maintenance-Helper works.
